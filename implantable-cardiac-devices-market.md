<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>BI-V ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardiac devices market comprises three primary types: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and biventricular ICDs (bi-V ICDs). Pacemakers regulate heart rhythms in patients with bradycardia, providing consistent electrical impulses. ICDs monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks to correct life-threatening arrhythmias. Bi-V ICDs combine features of standard ICDs with dual-chamber pacing to improve heart function in patients with heart failure. Collectively, these devices play a crucial role in managing various cardiac conditions and enhancing patients' quality of life.</p></p>
