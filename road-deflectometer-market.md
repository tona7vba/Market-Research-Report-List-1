<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Deflectometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)</li><li>Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Road Deflectometer market consists of two primary types: Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD). FWD is used for assessing the structural capacity of pavements by applying a predetermined load and measuring the deflection response, making it ideal for heavy-duty roads. LWD, on the other hand, is portable and evaluates soil and pavement stiffness under lighter loads, suitable for more localized assessments and rapid site evaluations. Both tools are crucial for effective pavement management and maintenance.</p></p>
