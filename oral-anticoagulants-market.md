<p><strong>The Oral Anticoagulants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VTE</li><li>ACS/MI</li><li>AF</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oral anticoagulants market primarily addresses three major applications: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction (ACS/MI), and atrial fibrillation (AF). VTE involves blood clots in veins, where anticoagulants prevent complications. ACS/MI requires anticoagulants to reduce clot formation during heart attacks, enhancing patient outcomes. AF, characterized by irregular heart rhythms, increases stroke risk, making anticoagulants essential for stroke prevention. Collectively, these applications drive the demand for effective anticoagulation therapies, improving patient safety and management of thromboembolic disorders.</p></p>
