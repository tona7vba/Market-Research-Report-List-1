<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electronic Braking System (EBS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brake</li><li>Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Electronic Braking System (EBS) market includes two primary types: Disc Brake and Drum Brake systems. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor, offering superior heat dissipation and consistent performance, making them ideal for high-speed and heavy-duty vehicles. Drum brakes, on the other hand, use brake shoes that press against a rotating drum, providing cost-effective and reliable braking, often used in smaller or budget-friendly vehicles. Both systems integrate EBS for enhanced safety, precision, and control.</p></p>
